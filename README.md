* JS Drum Kit

This is a code along i did as part of the JavaScript 30 challenge. 

It allowed me to use the event listener - something i knew abour but hadnt used much until this.

The JS Drum Kit is a set of keys in which you press on your keyboard (or click on the buttons on the screen themselves) and they should play the relevant sounds.
